## Summary

* Mathematician and developer
* 10+ years experience with fullstack software development
* 5+ years experience with data science and mathematical modelling
* 5+ years experience in (management) consulting

I am comfortable with all phases of consulting, software development and mathematical modelling. This allows me to 1) **assess** a problem together with a client, 2) **design** a suitable solution for the client's business, 3) **implement** the solution, iteratively if need be and 4) **deploy** the tooling at a suitable location.
